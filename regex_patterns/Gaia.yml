description: Gaia, Inc. is an American media company founded in 1988 by Jirka Rysavy
  in Louisville, Colorado. It owns and operates Gaia TV, a subscription video on-demand
  service consisting of original and licensed alternative media documentaries. While
  the content on Gaia TV initially focused on yoga, mindfulness, and alternative medicine
  to complement the company's yoga equipment distribution business, the latter's divestiture
  led to a greater emphasis on content promoting conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.[3]
  The service has been criticized and deplatformed from social media platforms including
  Facebook and YouTube for hosting videos promoting vaccine misinformation and conspiracy
  theories such as the Illuminati, UFOs, and Atlantis.
