name: Dolby Vision WEB-DL
description: 'This is a special Custom Format that blocks WEBDLs WITH Dolby Vision
  but WITHOUT HDR10 fallback.


  This Custom Format works together with the normal DV Custom Format that you would
  use to prefer Dolby Vision.


  Most WEBDL from Streaming Services DO NOT have the fallback to HDR10. During playback,
  issues with weird colors (typically a green hue) can result when you attempt to
  play it on a non-Dolby Vision-compatible setup.'
