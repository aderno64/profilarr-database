description: This is a custom profile based on the TRaSH Guides WEB-1080p Sonarr profile.
  By default, they have zero fallback tiers which is a real bummer when you are trying
  to fully automate your media library. Over the years, I have found this particular
  profile ensures you will always get a decent file pulled and upgraded to a recommended
  score.
