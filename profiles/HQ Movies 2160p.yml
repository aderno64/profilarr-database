name: HQ Movies 2160p
description: 'Based on the TRaSH Guides UHD Bluray + WEB profile, focusing on streaming
  optimized sources with little to no transcoding needed.

  - This profile is recommended for a set-it-and-forget-it setup.

  - This profile is recommended for those who want the highest quality 4K encodes
  without grabbing remuxes.

  - Ensure you add a delay tag to your setup. I prefer 30 minutes, but adjust this
  as needed.

  - This profile will allow for x265 on 1080p if and only if the release contains
  HDR/DV.'
