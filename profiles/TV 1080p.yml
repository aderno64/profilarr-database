description: 'Based on the TRaSH Guides WEB-1080p (Alternative) profile, focusing
  on balanced quality/file size.

  - This profile is recommended for a set-it-and-forget-it setup.

  - Ensure you add a delay tag to your setup. I prefer 30 minutes, but adjust this
  as needed.

  - This profile will allow for x265 on 1080p **if and only if** the release group
  is in a WEB Tier.'
