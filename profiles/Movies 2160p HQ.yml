description: 'This profile focuses on high-quality encodes with HD audio.

  - This profile is heavily based on the "UHD Bluray + WEB" profile from [**TRaSH
  Guides**](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/radarr-setup-quality-profiles/#uhd-bluray-web).

  - If you prefer the highest quality audio, consider following [**THIS GUIDE**](https://trash-guides.info/Radarr/radarr-setup-quality-profiles/#audio-formats)
  to add those HD audio formats to this profile.

  - This will prevent grabbing UHD/4k Remux and Bluray encode releases without HDR
  Formats. - i.e., SDR WEB releases will still be allowed since 4K SDR WEB releases
  can often look better than the 1080p version due to the improved bitrate.

  - If you''d prefer IMAX versions, add that format with a score of 800.

  - If you''d prefer IMAX Enhanced versions, add that format with a score of 800.

  - If you''d prefer Special Editions (i.e. Extended, Directors Cut, etc.), add that
  format with a score of 125.
