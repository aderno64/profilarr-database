name: Movies 2160p
description: 'Based on the TRaSH Guides SQP-1 profile, focusing on streaming optimized
  sources with little to no transcoding needed.

  - This profile is recommended for a set-it-and-forget-it setup.

  - Ensure you add a delay tag to your setup. I prefer 30 minutes, but adjust this
  as needed.

  - This profile will only grab 2160p Bluray releases if they are from **hallowed**
  or **BHDStudio**.

  - 1080p Blurays target **hallowed** or **BHDStudio**, but will fallback to a Dictionarry
  1080p Quality release.

  - This profile will allow for x265 on 1080p **if and only if** the release group
  is in a WEB Tier.'
