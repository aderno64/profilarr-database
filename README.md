# bedynamic Profilarr Database

Originally, I planned on replicating the TRaSH Guides set up for Profilarr, but over the years, I have found that the default TRaSH can really affect automation.

These profiles are based on the structure of the SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr) and the WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr) profiles. Using this database can be described as set-it-and-forget-it.
