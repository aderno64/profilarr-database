# bedynamic Profilarr Database

## Anime
These profiles are based on the TRaSH Guides Anime profile structure. Currently, we are only developing a 1080p profile.

Using these profiles:
- You will get a media file between a quality of SDTV - 1080p Remux
- You will be preferring Dual Audio media (ie including English along with original language)

## Movie and TV
These profiles are based on the structure of the SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr) and the WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr) profiles. Using this database can be described as set-it-and-forget-it.

We do use the Dictionarry formats and regex, but we also have made modifications and additions to better source media.

Using these profiles in Radarr:
- You will get a media file between a quality of 720p - Bluray 1080p/2160p.
- You want 2160p with DV + HDR10 but don't care about HD audio (TrueHD, DTS-HD, DTS-X).
- You want maximum compatibility across all devices.
- You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
- You're using your smart tv app as media player device.
- You want to grab streaming optimized releases.

Using these Profiles in Sonarr:
- You will get a media file between a quality of SDTV - WEB 1080p/2160p.
- You prefer having consistency across shows and seasons, including season packs.
- You will get high-quality, WEB-DL files.
- You can expect fallback to WEB-Rip, Bluray and HDTV if WEB-DL is unavailable.
- You can expect to grab a media file from any available resolution.
