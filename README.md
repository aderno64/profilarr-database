# Dumpstarr Database for Profilarr

Join the Discord! <a href="https://discord.gg/GuCgPN5KZM">LINK</a>

We use both Dictionarry and TRaSH formats/regex, but we also have made modifications and additions to better source media.

These profiles do use the Dictionarry release group tiers, but I have included the TRaSH Guides tier groups as well, in case you'd want to use those instead.

## Profile Selection Guide
- *Anime*: **Anime 1080p**
- *1080p TV Shows*: **TV 1080p**
- *2160p TV Shows*: **TV 2160p**
- *Streaming Optimized 1080p Movies*: **Movies 1080p**
- *Streaming Optimized 2160p Movies*: **Movies 2160p**
- *1080p Movies with HQ Audio*: **Movies 1080p HQ**
- *2160p Movies with HQ Audio*: **Movies 2160p HQ**

Note: If you'd prefer x265 releases and do not care about potential re-encodes, remove the "x265" format from your selected profile.

## Anime
This profile is based on the TRaSH Guides Anime profile structure. Currently, we are only developing a 1080p profile.

## Movie and TV
These profiles are based on the structure of the SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr) and the WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr) profiles. Using this database can be described as set-it-and-forget-it.

## Extras Included
- Automatic sync of the Dictionarry Group Tiers (UHD, HD, 720p, WEB and Remux).
- Fix for Parks and Recreation WEB-DL releases from NTb.
- Fix for Scrubs NTSC versions to avoid 25fps groups.
- Fix for HONE releases with bad naming.
