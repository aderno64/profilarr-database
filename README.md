## Anime
This profile is based on the TRaSH Guides Anime profile structure. Currently, we are only developing a 1080p profile.

## Movie and TV
These profiles are based on the structure of the SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr) and the WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr) profiles. Using this database can be described as set-it-and-forget-it.
