# bedynamic Profilarr Database

These profiles are based on the structure of the SQP-1 Alternative (Radarr) and the WEB-2160p/1080p Alternative (Sonarr) profiles. Using this database can be described as set-it-and-forget-it.

We do use the Dictionarry formats and regex, but we also have made modifications and additions to better source media.

Using these profiles, you can expect:
- You want 2160p with DV + HDR10 but don't care about HD audio (TrueHD, DTS-HD, DTS-X).
- You want maximum compatibility across all devices and still a HQ release.
- You run 2 instances of Radarr and want both version or you want to use this as your main.
- You want to have little to no transcoding for low powered devices or remote streaming.
- You're using your smart tv app as media player device.
- You want to grab streaming optimized releases.
