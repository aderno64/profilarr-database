# bedynamic Profilarr Database

Originally, I planned on replicating the TRaSH Guides set up for Profilarr, but over the years, I have found that TRaSH can really affect automation. I base these profiles off of my own setups and all you need to do is decide on the desired final resolution.

These profiles and formats are quality based so there are three Quality Tiers that apply to all types of media. Yes, these are initially based off of TRaSH Tiers, but I combined them for a one-size-fits-all approach. As I come across new groups, I judge the quality of the release based on file size, audio and video bitrate, audio channel availability, etc.
